## Libraries, Methods

## Background Information:

You can find the cloned repository here: https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks

The questions are remained the same, but the whole cleaning, analyzing and visualiyation process is different.

The cleaning process includes:
- Import all csv data into a Pandas dataframe
- Change the column types
- Drop all NaN values

After that I've started the analyzing and visualization process, along the required modifications in the dataframe. The questions are the following:
- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?
- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
